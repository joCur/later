# Later: Product Planning Documentation

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
Later is a flexible organizer app that lets you manage tasks, notes, and lists all in one place, works perfectly offline, and syncs across devices only when you want it to.

### Problem Statement
People are forced to use multiple apps or rigid todo systems that don't match their actual workflow, requiring constant internet connectivity and expensive subscriptions for basic productivity features.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Knowledge workers and creative professionals (25-45 years) who need flexible organization systems
- **Secondary**: Students and academics (18-30 years) managing multiple projects and research
- **Tertiary**: Personal productivity enthusiasts (30-55 years) organizing both work and personal life

### Unique Selling Proposition
The only productivity app that combines tasks, notes, and lists in a flexible workspace, works completely offline, offers optional syncing without subscriptions, and adapts to how you actually think rather than forcing you into a rigid system.

### Success Metrics
- **User Acquisition**: 50,000 active users within 6 months
- **Retention**: 60% monthly active user retention rate
- **Engagement**: Average 5+ items created per user per week
- **Offline Usage**: 40% of sessions occur in offline mode
- **Cross-device Sync**: 30% of users sync across multiple devices

## Conclusion

Later represents a fundamental shift in personal productivity software - from prescriptive to adaptive, from online-dependent to offline-first, from subscription-based to user-owned. By focusing on the core problems of fragmented organization, forced connectivity, and rigid structures, Later provides a solution that truly adapts to how people think and work.

The success of Later will be measured not by feature count, but by its ability to become invisible - a natural extension of users' thought processes that just works, wherever they are, however they think.
