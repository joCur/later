# Later MVP - Phase 1: Foundation & Local-First Core

## Objective and Scope

Build the foundational MVP for Later app focusing on **local-first functionality** with offline-capable item management. This phase establishes the core architecture, local database, basic UI components, and essential features without requiring backend sync or authentication.

**What's In Scope:**
- Flutter project setup with design system implementation
- Local database (Hive) for offline-first storage
- Basic item management (create, read, update, delete tasks/notes/lists)
- Space organization with switching capability
- Quick capture modal
- Responsive layouts (mobile-first, then tablet/desktop)
- Core UI components (item cards, buttons, inputs)

**What's Out of Scope (Future Phases):**
- Supabase backend integration and sync
- User authentication
- Cross-device sync
- Collaboration/sharing features
- Advanced search and filtering
- Natural language processing
- Voice input

## Technical Approach and Reasoning

### Architecture Decisions

**1. Local-First with Hive**
- **Why Hive:** Fast, lightweight, pure Dart NoSQL database perfect for offline-first
- **Reasoning:** Build and validate core features locally before adding backend complexity
- **Benefit:** Free development, no API quotas, instant testing

**2. Flutter with Material 3**
- **Why Material 3:** Modern design system with excellent theming support
- **Reasoning:** Cross-platform from day one, matches design system requirements
- **Benefit:** Single codebase for mobile, tablet, desktop, web

**3. Provider for State Management**
- **Why Provider:** Simple, officially recommended, minimal boilerplate
- **Reasoning:** MVP doesn't need complex state management; Provider handles local state well
- **Benefit:** Easy to understand, migrate later if needed

**4. Repository Pattern**
- **Why Repository:** Abstraction layer between data source and UI
- **Reasoning:** Easy to swap Hive for Supabase later without changing business logic
- **Benefit:** Clean architecture, testable, flexible

### Data Model Design

```dart
// Core models designed for both local and eventual backend sync
Item {
  String id;                    // UUID for future sync
  ItemType type;                // task, note, list
  String title;
  String? content;
  String spaceId;               // Foreign key to Space
  bool isCompleted;             // For tasks
  DateTime? dueDate;
  List<String> tags;
  DateTime createdAt;
  DateTime updatedAt;
  String? syncStatus;           // null (local-only), 'pending', 'synced'
}

Space {
  String id;                    // UUID
  String name;
  String? icon;
  String? color;
  int itemCount;
  bool isArchived;
  DateTime createdAt;
  DateTime updatedAt;
}
```

## Challenges and Considerations

### Technical Challenges

**Challenge 1: State Management Complexity**
- **Issue**: Managing state across items, spaces, and UI
- **Mitigation**: Use Provider with clear separation of concerns; repositories handle data, providers handle state
- **Fallback**: If Provider becomes unwieldy, consider Riverpod migration

**Challenge 2: Hive Performance with Large Datasets**
- **Issue**: Hive can slow down with 10,000+ items
- **Mitigation**: Use lazy loading, pagination, and indices for filtering
- **Monitoring**: Profile with DevTools, set performance budgets

**Challenge 3: Responsive Layout Complexity**
- **Issue**: Supporting mobile, tablet, desktop with single codebase
- **Mitigation**: Use LayoutBuilder and breakpoint helpers consistently
- **Testing**: Test on all target platforms regularly

**Challenge 4: Auto-Save Debouncing**
- **Issue**: Too frequent saves can impact performance, too slow loses data
- **Mitigation**: 500ms debounce with immediate save on navigation away
- **Testing**: Test rapid typing and abrupt app closure scenarios

### UX Considerations

**Consideration 1: First-Time User Experience**
- Provide helpful onboarding with sample data
- Use empty states with clear CTAs
- Progressively introduce features (don't overwhelm)

**Consideration 2: Offline-First Clarity**
- Users should never doubt that their data is saved
- Show immediate feedback for all actions
- Use auto-save exclusively (no manual save buttons)

**Consideration 3: Performance Perception**
- Use skeleton loaders instead of spinners
- Optimize for perceived performance (show UI immediately, load data after)
- Target <200ms for space switching

**Consideration 4: Accessibility from Day One**
- Build semantic structure from the start
- Test with screen readers during development
- Meet WCAG AA standards before launch

### Migration Path to Phase 2

**Preparing for Supabase Integration:**
- Use UUID for all IDs (compatible with Postgres)
- Include `syncStatus` field in models (not used yet, but ready)
- Repository pattern allows easy swap from Hive to Supabase
- Keep models simple and serializable (JSON-compatible)

**Data Migration Strategy:**
- Export Hive data to JSON format
- Import JSON to Supabase when user creates account
- Provide "Sync & Backup" feature in Phase 2

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Users can create tasks, notes, and lists locally
- ✅ Users can organize items into spaces
- ✅ Users can switch between spaces quickly (<200ms)
- ✅ Users can complete tasks with checkbox toggle
- ✅ Users can edit and delete items
- ✅ Quick capture works with keyboard shortcut
- ✅ App works completely offline
- ✅ Data persists across app restarts

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ App launches in <2 seconds
- ✅ Space switching completes in <200ms
- ✅ Scrolling maintains 60fps with 100+ items
- ✅ Auto-save debounce works smoothly without data loss

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ Zero crashes during normal operation
- ✅ Passes accessibility audit (TalkBack, VoiceOver)
- ✅ WCAG AA color contrast compliance
- ✅ All interactive elements ≥44x44dp touch targets
- ✅ Widget test coverage >70% for core logic

### User Experience Requirements
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between item types (color border + icon)
- ✅ Intuitive navigation (bottom nav on mobile, sidebar on desktop)
- ✅ Helpful empty states guide users
- ✅ Confirmation for destructive actions only
- ✅ Loading states prevent perceived lag

## Next Phase Preview

**Phase 2: Supabase Backend & Sync** will introduce:
- Supabase CLI setup with local development
- Database schema migrations (items, spaces tables)
- Row-Level Security policies
- Authentication (email + OAuth providers)
- Real-time sync with conflict resolution
- Multi-device support

Phase 1 establishes the foundation that makes Phase 2 integration straightforward through the repository abstraction layer.
