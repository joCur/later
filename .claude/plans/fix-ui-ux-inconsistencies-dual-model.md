# Fix UI/UX Inconsistencies in Dual-Model Architecture

## Objective and Scope

Fix UI/UX inconsistencies in detail screens (TodoListDetailScreen, ListDetailScreen, NoteDetailScreen) to align with the mobile-first design system. The primary goal is to ensure all screens follow consistent responsive modal patterns (bottom sheets on mobile, dialogs on desktop) and use proper FAB styling (circular icon-only on mobile, extended with labels on desktop).

**MVP Focus**:
- Create reusable responsive modal and FAB infrastructure
- Update the three detail screens to use new patterns
- Fix Dismissible background styling to match card design
- Ensure all changes are properly tested

## Technical Approach and Reasoning

**Why This Approach**:
- **Consistency First**: HomeScreen and SpaceSwitcherModal already demonstrate correct patterns - we'll replicate their approach
- **Infrastructure Before Implementation**: Build reusable utilities (`ResponsiveModal`, `BottomSheetContainer`, `ResponsiveFab`) to prevent code duplication
- **Mobile-First Philosophy**: Bottom sheets are native mobile patterns; dialogs work well on desktop
- **Centralized Logic**: One place to manage responsive behavior reduces maintenance burden

**Key Technical Decisions**:
1. Use `Breakpoints.isMobile(context)` for consistent responsive detection
2. Create wrapper widgets that handle both mobile and desktop variants internally
3. Match existing patterns from HomeScreen's Quick Capture implementation
4. Fix Dismissible backgrounds to match card border radius (8px) and spacing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Create Responsive Modal Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED (Updated)

**Goal**: Build reusable utilities for responsive modals and FABs that handle mobile/desktop variants automatically.

**Update (Phase 3 Post-Implementation)**:
- Fixed BottomSheetContainer full-screen issue by changing `Expanded` to `Flexible` in mobile layout
- This allows bottom sheets to size to content instead of filling all available space
- All tests still pass (61 tests across ListDetailScreen and TodoListDetailScreen)

- [x] Task 1.1: Create ResponsiveModal utility class ✅
  - Created file `apps/later_mobile/lib/core/utils/responsive_modal.dart`
  - Implemented static `show<T>()` method with `BuildContext`, `Widget child`, and optional `isScrollControlled` parameter
  - Uses `Breakpoints.isMobile(context)` to determine platform
  - Mobile: uses `showModalBottomSheet<T>()` with `backgroundColor: Colors.transparent` and `isScrollControlled: true`
  - Desktop: uses `showDialog<T>()` with standard dialog builder
  - Added comprehensive dartdoc comments explaining usage and parameters

- [x] Task 1.2: Create BottomSheetContainer widget ✅
  - Created file `apps/later_mobile/lib/widgets/components/modals/bottom_sheet_container.dart`
  - StatelessWidget with parameters: `Widget child`, `String? title`, `double? height`
  - Build method checks `Breakpoints.isMobile(context)` for responsive behavior
  - Mobile: Container with 24px top corner radius, drag handle (32×4px, 12px margin), optional title with AppTypography.h3, and Expanded child
  - Desktop: Dialog with maxWidth 560px constraint, optional title, and Flexible child
  - Uses `Theme.of(context).scaffoldBackgroundColor` for background color
  - Drag handle: Container with width: 32, height: 4, borderRadius: 2, color: AppColors.neutral400

- [x] Task 1.3: Create ResponsiveFab widget ✅
  - Created file `apps/later_mobile/lib/widgets/components/fab/responsive_fab.dart`

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Required Dependencies** (already in pubspec.yaml):
- `flutter_riverpod`: State management for screens
- `hive_flutter`: Local storage (already used)
- No new external dependencies needed

**Internal Dependencies**:
- `lib/core/theme/breakpoints.dart`: Breakpoint utilities (already exists)
- `lib/core/theme/app_colors.dart`: Color constants (already exists)
- `lib/core/theme/app_typography.dart`: Typography constants (already exists)
- `lib/core/theme/app_spacing.dart`: Spacing constants (already exists)
- `lib/widgets/components/fab/quick_capture_fab.dart`: Existing FAB component to reuse

**Prerequisites**:
- Dual-model architecture must be fully implemented (Phase 8 complete)
- All existing tests must be passing before starting
- Design system documentation (`MOBILE-FIRST-BOLD-REDESIGN.md`, `MOBILE_DESIGN_CHEAT_SHEET.md`) must be reviewed

## Challenges and Considerations

**Challenge 1: Existing Tests Will Break**
- **Impact**: Many widget tests currently expect `AlertDialog`, not bottom sheets
- **Mitigation**: Update tests to mock `Breakpoints.isMobile()` and test both paths
- **Approach**: Use `setUp()` blocks to configure mobile vs desktop mode per test

**Challenge 2: Keyboard Handling in Bottom Sheets**
- **Impact**: Bottom sheets must resize when keyboard appears (especially for TodoItemDialog with multiple fields)
- **Mitigation**: Use `isScrollControlled: true` and wrap content in `SingleChildScrollView`
- **Testing**: Manual test on physical devices with keyboard open

**Challenge 3: Animation Timing and Feel**
- **Impact**: Bottom sheet animations must feel natural and match platform conventions
- **Mitigation**: Use default Material bottom sheet animations (already optimized by Flutter)
- **Testing**: Test on real devices, not just simulators

**Challenge 4: Dismissible Background Alignment**
- **Impact**: Delete icon must visually align with card center during swipe
- **Mitigation**: Match background margin/padding to card styling exactly
- **Testing**: Test swipe gesture on physical devices for smooth visual feedback

**Challenge 5: TextField Focus Management**
- **Impact**: When bottom sheet opens, TextField should auto-focus for quick input
- **Mitigation**: Use `autofocus: true` on primary TextField in forms
- **Testing**: Verify keyboard appears immediately when modal opens

**Challenge 6: Gradient FAB on Mobile**
- **Impact**: `QuickCaptureFab` may need adjustments to support different gradients (task, list, note)
- **Mitigation**: Review `QuickCaptureFab` implementation and add gradient parameter if needed
- **Alternative**: Create FAB directly with `Container` + `BoxDecoration` gradient if wrapper doesn't support it

**Edge Cases to Handle**:
1. **Very long TodoItem titles**: Ensure bottom sheet content scrolls properly
2. **Small screens (iPhone SE)**: Test bottom sheet height doesn't exceed screen
3. **Landscape orientation**: Verify bottom sheets and FABs position correctly
4. **Rapid open/close**: Ensure no race conditions with modal state
5. **Empty required fields**: Ensure validation works in bottom sheets
6. **Swipe-to-delete with short swipe**: Ensure Dismissible threshold is appropriate

**Design System Compliance Checklist**:
- [ ] Bottom sheets have 24px top corner radius
- [ ] Bottom sheets include 32×4px drag handle, 12px from top
- [ ] Bottom sheets use solid surface color (no glass effect)
- [ ] FABs on mobile are 56×56px circular
- [ ] FABs on mobile have 28px border radius (half of 56)
- [ ] FABs on mobile use gradient with 30% white overlay
- [ ] FABs on mobile have NO text labels (icon only)
- [ ] FABs have correct shadow (8px offset, 16px blur, 15% opacity)
- [ ] Dismissible backgrounds match card border radius (8px)
- [ ] All touch targets minimum 48×48px

**Implementation Timeline**: 2 weeks (1 developer)
**Priority**: High (affects UX consistency and design system compliance)
**Risk Level**: Medium (requires careful testing, but well-defined scope)
