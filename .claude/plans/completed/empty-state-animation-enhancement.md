# Empty State Animation Enhancement Plan

## Objective and Scope

Enhance empty state screens (HomeScreen, TodoListDetailScreen, ListDetailScreen) with engaging animations that guide users to create their first item. The animations will feature:
- ~~Curved arrow pointing from empty state to the FAB/create button~~ (REMOVED - not working as expected)
- Pulsing/bouncing animation on the create button
- Smooth entrance animations for the empty state content

This enhancement aims to improve user onboarding and make the "create first item" action more discoverable and inviting.

**Note**: The curved arrow pointer has been removed from the implementation as it didn't work as expected. Focus is now on entrance animations and FAB pulse animation.

## Technical Approach and Reasoning

**Animation Library**: Use `flutter_animate` (already in use) for declarative animations with spring physics matching the existing design system.

**Component Architecture**:
- Create a new `AnimatedEmptyState` organism component that wraps the existing `EmptyState`
- Create a reusable `CurvedArrowPointer` atom component for the animated arrow
- Enhance empty state views in HomeScreen, TodoListDetailScreen, and ListDetailScreen
- Add pulsing animation controller to the FAB when displayed in empty state context

**Design Considerations**:
- Use existing `AppAnimations` tokens for consistent timing (gentle spring, normal duration)
- Curved arrow should use a custom painter for smooth Bezier curves
- Pulse animation should be subtle and non-intrusive (scale 1.0 → 1.08 → 1.0)
- Animation should respect `MediaQuery.disableAnimations` for accessibility
- Arrow should adapt to screen size and FAB position

**Integration Pattern**:
- Empty states will conditionally render the animated version on first mount
- Use a flag to prevent showing animation after first dismissal (stored in shared preferences)
- Animation plays once when empty state is first shown, can be dismissed or auto-hides after 10 seconds

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Create Curved Arrow Component (REMOVED)
- [x] ~~Task 1.1: Create `CurvedArrowPointer` atom component~~ (Removed - arrow not working as expected)
- [x] ~~Task 1.2: Add arrow to design system exports~~ (Removed - arrow not working as expected)

**Decision**: The curved arrow pointer feature has been removed from the implementation as it didn't work as expected. The component files remain in the codebase but are no longer used.

### Phase 2: Create Pulsing Animation for FAB
- [x] Task 2.1: Add pulse animation state to QuickCaptureFab
  - Modified `apps/later_mobile/lib/design_system/molecules/fab/quick_capture_fab.dart`
  - Added optional `enablePulse` boolean parameter (default false)
  - Implemented pulse animation using `flutter_animate` with scale 1.0 → 1.08 → 1.0
  - Pulse animation stops on user interaction or after 10 seconds
  - Used `flutter_animate`'s `.animate().scale()` with repeat and bouncy spring curve
  - Respects reduced motion preferences via `AppAnimations.prefersReducedMotion(context)`

- [x] Task 2.2: Add pulse animation to ResponsiveFab
  - Modified `apps/later_mobile/lib/design_system/organisms/fab/responsive_fab.dart`
  - Converted to StatefulWidget to manage pulse state
  - Added optional `enablePulse` boolean parameter (default false)
  - Passes `enablePulse` to QuickCaptureFab for mobile layout
  - Implemented pulse animation for desktop extended FAB
  - Pulse respects reduced motion preferences

### Phase 3: Create Animated Empty State Component

  - Created new file `apps/later_mobile/lib/design_system/organisms/empty_states/animated_empty_state.dart`
  - Accepts `EmptyState` properties plus `enableFabPulse` parameter
  - ~~Uses `LayoutBuilder` to calculate FAB position relative to empty state~~ (Removed)
  - ~~Positions curved arrow from message text to FAB location~~ (Removed)
  - Simplified to just entrance animations and FAB pulse trigger
  - ~~Added dismiss button (X icon) in top-right corner~~ (Removed)
  - Emits callback to enable FAB pulse after entrance animation completes

- [x] Task 3.2: Implement animation sequencing (SIMPLIFIED)
  - Used `flutter_animate` for entrance animations
  - Empty state: fade in + scale (0.95 → 1.0) with `AppAnimations.gentleSpring`
  - ~~Arrow: fade in with 300ms delay + built-in draw animation~~ (Removed)
  - ~~Dismiss button: fade in + scale with 600ms delay~~ (Removed)
  - FAB pulse: triggered via callback after entrance completes (~500ms)
  - Respects reduced motion preferences

## Challenges and Considerations

**Challenge 1: Accurate FAB Position Calculation**
- FAB position is managed by Flutter's FloatingActionButton positioning
- May need to use `GlobalKey` with `RenderBox` to get precise coordinates
- Alternative: Use fixed offset based on screen size (simpler, less precise)
- Solution: Start with fixed offset approach, use GlobalKey only if needed

**Challenge 2: Arrow Path Calculation**
- Need to draw smooth Bezier curve from empty state text to FAB
- Control points must be calculated based on start/end positions
- Arrow should curve naturally (typically curve upward, then down to FAB)
- Solution: Use quadratic Bezier with control point offset vertically and horizontally

**Challenge 3: Animation Timing Coordination**
- Multiple animations need to be coordinated across components
- FAB pulse in separate widget from empty state
- Need clean communication pattern
- Solution: Use callbacks to trigger FAB pulse from AnimatedEmptyState lifecycle

**Challenge 4: Performance with Custom Painter**
- Custom painting can be expensive if not cached
- Arrow needs to animate smoothly without jank
- Solution: Use `RepaintBoundary` around arrow, cache painter when possible

**Challenge 5: First-Time Experience Detection**
- Need reliable way to detect first-time users vs. returning users
- Should work even if user closes app and returns
- Solution: SharedPreferences with per-screen flags

**Challenge 6: Reduced Motion Accessibility**
- Users with motion sensitivity need alternative experience
- Animations should respect system preferences
- Solution: Check `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`, show static arrow if needed

**Edge Cases:**
- User creates item before animation completes (animation should gracefully exit)
- User switches tabs/spaces during animation (animation should pause/reset)
- Keyboard covers FAB on mobile (arrow should adjust or hide)
- Screen rotation during animation (re-calculate positions)

**Design Decisions:**
- Arrow color: Use theme-aware primary gradient color at 60% opacity for subtlety
- Arrow style: Dashed line with animated dash offset for "drawing" effect
- Pulse scale: 1.08 max (subtle, not distracting)
- Animation duration: 10 seconds total (3s entrance + 7s pulse, then auto-dismiss)
- Dismiss interaction: Tap anywhere on screen or tap explicit X button
