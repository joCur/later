# Localization and German Keyword Detection Implementation Plan

## Objective and Scope

Implement Flutter's official localization system with support for English and German languages, including multilingual keyword detection for the item type detector. This will enable the Later Mobile app to automatically detect tasks, lists, and notes in both languages with culturally appropriate keyword matching.

**Scope:**
- Set up official Flutter localization infrastructure (`intl` + `flutter_localizations`)
- Create English and German ARB files for UI strings
- Implement hybrid keyword detection system with synonym support
- Refactor `ItemTypeDetector` to support multiple languages
- Establish translation workflow and testing framework

**Out of Scope:**
- Additional languages beyond English and German (Phase 1)
- Downloadable language packs
- Advanced NLP/ML-based detection
- Translation management platform integration

## Technical Approach and Reasoning

**Chosen Approach: Official Flutter Localization + Hybrid Keyword Strategy**

1. **Flutter's `intl` + `flutter_localizations`:**
   - Type-safe, compile-time checked translations
   - Official support with long-term stability
   - Excellent performance (build-time generation)
   - Already have `intl: ^0.19.0` in dependencies

2. **Hybrid Keyword Detection:**
   - ARB files for UI strings (type-safe)
   - Separate JSON files for keyword dictionaries with synonyms
   - Abstraction layer (`KeywordProvider`) for flexibility
   - Language-specific customization without tight coupling

3. **Why Not Alternatives:**
   - `easy_localization`: Lacks type safety, not future-proof
   - `slang`: Smaller community, less documentation
   - Full NLP: Overkill for keyword matching, performance overhead

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Localization Infrastructure

**Goal: Set up Flutter localization framework with English as baseline**

- [ ] Task 1.1: Add dependencies and configuration
  - Add `flutter_localizations` to `pubspec.yaml` dependencies section (already have `intl: ^0.19.0`)
  - Add `generate: true` under `flutter:` section in `pubspec.yaml`
  - Create `l10n.yaml` in project root with configuration:
    ```yaml
    arb-dir: lib/l10n
    template-arb-file: app_en.arb
    output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
    ```

- [ ] Task 1.2: Create directory structure and initial ARB files
  - Create `lib/l10n/` directory
  - Create `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` with initial English translations
  - Include all existing UI strings from the app (screens, buttons, labels)
  - Add metadata for each entry with descriptions
  - Run `flutter pub get` to trigger code generation
  - Verify generated files appear in `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/`

- [ ] Task 1.3: Configure MaterialApp for localization
  - Import generated localizations in `main.dart`: `import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart';`
  - Add `localizationsDelegates: AppLocalizations.localizationsDelegates` to MaterialApp
  - Add `supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales` to MaterialApp
  - Remove any hardcoded locale settings
  - Test that app builds successfully

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Dependencies:**
- `flutter_localizations: sdk: flutter` (new)
- `intl: ^0.19.0` (already in project)
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.0` (for language preference storage)

**Assets:**
- `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` - English translations
- `lib/l10n/app_de.arb` - German translations
- `lib/l10n/keywords_en.json` - English keyword dictionary
- `lib/l10n/keywords_de.json` - German keyword dictionary

**Prerequisites:**
- Existing `ItemTypeDetector` remains functional throughout refactoring
- Access to native German speakers for validation
- No breaking changes to existing item detection API
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing items in database

**External Resources:**
- German task management keyword research
- German localization best practices
- Native German speaker for translation validation

## Challenges and Considerations

**Challenge 1: German Compound Words**
- German frequently combines words into compounds (e.g., "Wochenendeinkauf")
- Solution: Include common compounds in keyword dictionary
- Consider substring matching for unknown compounds
- Test extensively with real-world German input

**Challenge 2: Formal vs. Informal German**
- German has formal (Sie) and informal (du) forms
- Considerations: Decide on app voice and be consistent
- Include both forms in keywords if users might use either
- Document decision in translation guidelines

**Challenge 3: Regional Variations**
- German varies between Germany, Austria, and Switzerland
- Solution: Start with standard German (Hochdeutsch)
- Note regional variations for future expansion
- Consider user feedback from different regions

**Challenge 4: Translation Quality**
- Poor translations reduce detection accuracy
- Solution: Work with native German speakers
- Implement review process for translations
- Create clear context in ARB descriptions
- Test with German users early and often

**Challenge 5: Date and Time Parsing**
- German date formats differ from English (DD.MM.YYYY vs. MM/DD/YYYY)
- Time expressions may be structured differently
- Solution: Update date extraction logic to be locale-aware
- Use `intl` package's date formatting capabilities
- Add comprehensive date parsing tests for German

**Challenge 6: Performance with Multiple Languages**
- Loading multiple keyword dictionaries increases memory
- Solution: Lazy load only active language
- Cache parsed JSON to avoid repeated parsing
- Profile and optimize if needed
- Set performance budgets (< 50ms detection time)

**Challenge 7: Testing Complexity**
- Must test both languages thoroughly
- Solution: Create parameterized tests
- Use test fixtures for each language
- Implement automated test generation for keywords
- Set up CI to run all language tests

**Challenge 8: Maintaining Keyword Parity**
- English and German dictionaries may drift out of sync
- Solution: Create validation script
- Document keyword addition process
- Review both languages when adding keywords
- Consider tooling to flag inconsistencies

**Challenge 9: Mixed-Language Content**
- Users might mix English and German
- Solution: Consider detecting multiple languages (future)
- For now, detect based on app language setting
- Document this limitation
- Gather data on mixed-language usage

**Challenge 10: Cultural Differences in Task Management**
- Germans may structure tasks differently than English speakers
- Solution: Research German productivity culture
- Adjust scoring weights if needed per language
- Allow language-specific detection rules
- Validate with German users
