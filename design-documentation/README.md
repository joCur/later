# later - Design Documentation

> **A unified productivity experience that flows with your thoughts**

## Overview

This documentation contains the complete design system, specifications, and implementation guidelines for "later" - a productivity app that unifies tasks, notes, and lists in a single fluid interface.

## Design Philosophy

later's design language is built on the concept of **"Temporal Flow"** - the idea that productivity tools should feel like extensions of thought rather than rigid organizational systems. Our design emphasizes:

- **Fluid Motion**: Smooth, physics-based animations that feel natural and responsive
- **Adaptive Depth**: Subtle use of elevation and blur to create spatial hierarchy
- **Chromatic Intelligence**: Dynamic color system that adapts to context and content type
- **Gestural Intimacy**: Touch-first interactions that feel personal and immediate
- **Minimalist Boldness**: Strong typography and strategic use of whitespace

## 🎉 NEW: Mobile-First Bold Redesign

**⚠️ Important Update** (2025-10-21): We've created a **mobile-first bold redesign** that addresses mobile performance and visual distinctiveness:

- **[Mobile-First Bold Redesign](./MOBILE-FIRST-BOLD-REDESIGN.md)** - Complete mobile design strategy
- **[Mobile Implementation Quick Start](./MOBILE_IMPLEMENTATION_QUICK_START.md)** - Developer guide
- **[Mobile Visual Comparison](./MOBILE_VISUAL_COMPARISON.md)** - Before/after comparison

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ 6px gradient pill borders (vs 2px subtle strips) = **visible on phones**
- ✅ 18px bold titles (vs 16px) = **readable at a glance**
- ✅ Solid backgrounds (no gradient fills) = **60fps on old Android**
- ✅ Circular FAB (not squircle) = **Android-native feel**
- ✅ Icon-only navigation = **more spacious on small screens**

**Why?** The current "Temporal Flow" design is desktop-first. On mobile phones (320-414px), it looks generic and performs poorly. The mobile-first redesign is **bold, distinctive, and 60fps on 4-year-old devices.**

## Design Principles

### 1. Fluid Over Fixed
Every interaction should feel continuous and natural. We avoid abrupt transitions and favor smooth, physics-based animations that respect user intent.

### 2. Content First, Always
Chrome is minimal. Content is hero. Every pixel of UI should serve the user's productivity goals.

### 3. Adaptive Intelligence
The interface adapts to context - colors shift based on item type, spacing adjusts to content density, and interactions respond to user patterns.

### 4. Gestural Intimacy
Touch is conversation. Every tap, swipe, and long-press should feel responsive and purposeful, with immediate visual and haptic feedback.

### 5. Luminous Depth
We use light, shadow, and blur to create depth without heaviness. Layers feel distinct but connected, like sheets of glass.

## Visual Identity

**later** is distinguished by:
- **Gradient-infused interfaces** with subtle chromatic transitions
- **Generous whitespace** that gives content room to breathe
- **Bold, confident typography** using Inter and JetBrains Mono
- **Soft, rounded corners** throughout (12-20px radii)
- **Glass morphism effects** for overlays and elevated surfaces
- **Physics-based micro-interactions** that feel alive

## Design System Version

**Version 1.0.0** - Initial comprehensive design system
- Complete color palette with light/dark modes
- Typography system with responsive scaling
- Component library with 15+ core components
- Animation system with standardized timings
- Platform-specific adaptations for iOS/Android/Web
