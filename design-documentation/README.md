# later - Design Documentation

> **A unified productivity experience that flows with your thoughts**

## Overview

This documentation contains the complete design system, specifications, and implementation guidelines for "later" - a productivity app that unifies tasks, notes, and lists in a single fluid interface.

**Current Focus**: Mobile-First Bold Redesign - optimized for performance and visual distinctiveness on small screens.

## Design Philosophy

later's mobile-first design emphasizes:

- **Bold & Distinctive**: Thick gradient borders, strong typography, and clear visual hierarchy
- **Performance First**: Solid backgrounds, optimized animations, 60fps on older devices
- **Mobile Native**: Circular FAB, icon-only navigation, thumb-friendly interactions
- **Clear Hierarchy**: 6px gradient pill borders that are actually visible on phones
- **Readable Content**: 18px bold titles, generous spacing, high contrast

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Mobile-First, Always
Every design decision prioritizes the mobile experience. Desktop is an enhancement, not the baseline.

### 2. Performance is Non-Negotiable
We choose solid colors over gradients, simple animations over complex effects, and native patterns over custom solutions.

### 3. Boldness Over Subtlety
If it's not visible on a 320px screen at arm's length, it's too subtle. Our designs are confident and clear.

### 4. Content First
Minimal chrome, maximum content. Every pixel serves the user's productivity goals.

### 5. Gestural Intimacy
Touch is conversation. Swipes, taps, and long-presses feel responsive with immediate visual and haptic feedback.

## What Changed from v1.0

**v1.0 (Temporal Flow)** was desktop-first with glass morphism, subtle borders, and gradient-heavy designs. It looked generic on mobile and performed poorly on older devices.

**v2.0 (Mobile-First Bold)** addresses these issues:

- âœ… **6px gradient pill borders** (vs 2px subtle strips) = visible on phones
- âœ… **18px bold titles** (vs 16px) = readable at a glance
- âœ… **Solid backgrounds** (no gradient fills) = 60fps on old Android
- âœ… **Circular FAB** (not squircle) = Android-native feel
- âœ… **Icon-only navigation** = more spacious on small screens

## Visual Identity

**later** is distinguished by:

- **Thick gradient pill borders** on all cards (6px width)
- **Bold, confident typography** with clear size hierarchy
- **Generous whitespace** that gives content room to breathe
- **Solid color backgrounds** for performance
- **Circular floating action button** with gradient
- **Icon-only bottom navigation** with gradient underline indicators
- **Spring-physics animations** that feel alive
