## Performance Considerations

### Package Size Impact

| Package | Approx. Size | Impact | Justification |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| google_fonts | ~150KB | Low | Caches fonts, only loads used fonts |
| flutter_animate | ~50KB | Very Low | Powerful animation with small footprint |
| flutter_slidable | ~30KB | Very Low | Essential feature, optimized |
| riverpod | ~80KB | Low | Replaces need for other state management |
| hive | ~200KB | Medium | Fast NoSQL, replaces larger DBs |

**Total estimated impact**: ~500-600KB (acceptable for feature set)

### Optimization Tips

1. **Lazy load** heavy packages only when needed
2. **Tree-shake** unused code with `--split-debug-info`
3. **Cache** fonts and images aggressively
4. **Use const** constructors wherever possible
5. **Profile** regularly with DevTools

---

## Alternative Packages (Not Recommended)

### Why Not These?

**provider** → Use riverpod instead (better DX, type-safe)
**bloc** → Use riverpod instead (less boilerplate)
**sqflite** → Use hive instead (faster, easier)
**animated_text_kit** → Use flutter_animate (more flexible)
**getx** → Use go_router + riverpod (better separation)

---

## Package Update Strategy

### Recommended Schedule

- **Major updates**: Every 6 months (review breaking changes)
- **Minor updates**: Monthly (bug fixes, features)
- **Security patches**: Immediately
- **Flutter SDK**: Update with stable releases

### Update Commands

```bash
# Check for outdated packages
flutter pub outdated

# Update all to latest compatible versions
flutter pub upgrade

# Update to major versions (review breaking changes first)
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
```

---

## License Compliance

All recommended packages use permissive licenses:

- **MIT**: Most packages (google_fonts, riverpod, etc.)
- **BSD**: Some animation packages
- **Apache 2.0**: Some Google packages

**Note**: Always review licenses before commercial use.
